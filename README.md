# Ruby Exercises and Terminology
[Link to exercises](https://github.com/cruzgerman216/CodeLabs-Ruby-on-Rails-Exercises) <br>
Here is a list of ruby terms and definitions used in class.

## Part 1
<em>**Layer of Abstraction**</em> - Ensures that users aren't directly in contact with what is happening in the source code/logic <br>
<em>**Data Type**</em> - Attributes of data that tells the computer how to interpret that data. <br>
<em>**Variable**</em> - Abstract storage location that can be referenced via a predefined name. <br>
<em>**What's the difference between a local variable, constant variable, and a global variable?**</em> - A local variable can only be utilized within the scope of the program it is defined, constant variables never change, and a global variable can be accessed from anywhere in the program. <br>
<em>**What does scope mean?**</em> - The area within a program that something can be accessed. <br>
<em>**Constant Variable**</em> - A variable that never changes. <br>
<em>**Method**</em> - A re-usable block of code that performs a specific function. <br>
<em>**IRB**</em> - Interactive Ruby shell is a REPL that takes user inputs, evaluates them, and returns the result to the user.  <br>
<em>**Operators**</em> - A character(s) that specifies an actions that is going to be taken. <br>
<em>**Class**</em> - Is a capsule that defines the variables and methods. In other words its a template. <br>
<em>**Gem**</em> - Open source libraries used in Ruby. Equivalent to packages in angular. <br>

## Part 2
<em>**Conditional**</em> - Expressions that evaluate to either true or false <br>
<em>**The difference between if, elseif and else.**</em> - If is a condition with only one argument. elseif has the 
if condition and then more conditions to evaluate if the if is evaluates to false. Else is what is suppose to be 
evaluated if the previous condition is false. <br>
<em>**What are Case/When statements? </em> - type of selection control mechanism used to allow the value of a 
variable or expression to change the control flow of program execution via a multiway branch. <br>
<em>**What is a data structure? </em> - Is a format that allows for data organization, storage and manipulation <rb>
<em>**Arrays**</em> - A list of of ordered values <br>
<em>**What is meant by 'built-in' methods?**</em> - Methods that are supported by the language without said methods 
being installed from an external source. <br>
<em>**Loops**</em> - Blocks of code that is ran repeatedly until the argument resolves to false or if a piece of 
code explicitly breaks out of the loop. 
<br>
<em>**What are infinite loops?**</em> - Loops who's arguments never resolve to false and does not have the ability 
to break out of the cycle. <br>

## Part 3
<em>**What is Object Oriented Programming?**</em> - Is a programming methodology that visualizes values, structures, 
and other data as objects with defined properties.<br>
<em>**Class inheritance**</em> - Is how a child class inherits the attributes and methods of the parent class. <br>
<em>**What are getters and setters?**</em> - Getters are used to get the values of an instance variable while 
setters are used to set the value of a class' instance variable. <br>
<em>**Difference between class variables and instance variables and class attributes?**</em> -  class variables are 
shared between a class and all its subclasses, while class instance variables only belong to one specific class. 
An attribute is just the definition of a storage location. <br>
<em>**What does self signify in a class?**</em> - self points to the object that "owns" the currently executing code.<br>
<em>**Modules</em> - Modules are like packages that bundle reusable code that can be called by different parts of 
the program or by other programs.<br>
